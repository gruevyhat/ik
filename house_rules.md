HOUSE RULES
============

# I. Specific Spells, Skills, and Abilities

## SPELL: CHAIN LIGHTNING
The last sentence of the spell description should read: "Each character the lightning arcs to suffers a POW 10 electrical damage roll *if the original attack roll equals or exceeds his/her DEF*."

## BATTLE PLAN: SHADOW
This ability grants Prowl for 1 round in combat or 1 minute out of combat. 

## PROWL
This ability grants a +2 to Sneak checks in addition to other effects stated in IKFMF. It does not, however, confer invisibility. Prowling characters can still be seen if they fail a Sneak check; they just can't be hit by ranged attacks from more than 5" away. 

# II. Modifications of Existing Rules

## AOE SPELLS
AOE spells may target an arbitrary point in space. 

## REALISTIC TRAINING TIMES
Skills that can be used untrained take (1d6 * new rating) days of practice to reach a new level. Skills requiring training take (2d6 * new rating) weeks of instruction. A base learning time roll may be made once for the entire party during periods of down time.

## HUGE STATURE
If a weapon has both two-handed and one-handed attack modifiers, the Ogrun may use the weapon one-handed with the (lower) two-handed modified. If the weapon may not usually be used one-handed, the Ogrun may use it one-handed with a -2 penalty.

## DEADLY WAR{NOUN}S
Physical attacks on warjacks/warbeasts are -1d6 damage. Physical attacks made by warjacks/warbeasts are +1d6 damage. Spells and elemental conditions affect war{noun}s normally.

# III. New Rules

## INSANITY

### Sanity Checks and Loss
Sanity checks are made when characters are confronted with the terrifying, the gruesome, and the unfathomable. Characters have a derived Sanity attribute equal to (PHY + INT + PER - ARC). Sanity may be temporarily lost like Vitality points. When a character encounters something horrific, s/he rolls 2d6 + Willpower. If this number meets or exceeds a target number determined by the GM, the encounter has no effect. If the character fails the roll, s/he loses a number of temporary Sanity points determined by the GM. If a character is reduced to zero Sanity, his/her player should roll 3d6 on the Insanity Effects Table and immediately resolves any effects. 

### Insanity Effects Table
Roll | Effect
-----|-------
3    | Homicidal or suicidal mania, long term.
4    | Reactive psychosis (hallucinations or delusions), long term.
5    | Loses ability to communicate via speech or writing, long term. 
6    | Severe phobia, long term. 
7    | Mild phobia, long term. 
8    | Reactive psychosis. 
9    | Flees in panic. 
10   | Physical hysterics or emotional outburst (laughing, crying, etc.). 
11   | Babbling, incoherent, rapid speech, or logorrhea (a torrent of coherent speech). 
12   | Screaming fit. 
13   | Catatonia (can stand but has no will or interest; may be led or forced to simple actions but takes no independent action) or stupor (assumes foetal position, oblivious to events). 
14   | Minor manic behavior, long term. 
15   | Paranoia, long term. 
16   | Amnesia, long term. 
17   | Psychosomatic impairment (blindness, deafness, or the loss of the use of a limb or limbs), long term. 
18   | Catatonia or stupor, long term. 

Effects designated 'long term' remain until treated by an alienist for a period of 2d6 months; they may also be completely removed with the Heal spell, with all the usual effects of Pain of Healing. Otherwise, effects last 2d6 rounds, or minutes if the character is not in combat. 

### Recovery
Temporary Sanity may be recovered at the same rate as recovered Vitality. 

Sanity may be *permanently* lost in two ways:

1. Rolling double ones on a sanity check results in the permanent loss of one SAN. 
2. Gaining a skill level in Lore (Infernal) or Lore (Orboros).

When a character reaches zero permanent Sanity, s/he is permanently insane. 

When a character goes up a level (i.e., from hero to veteran or veteran to epic) s/he gains 1d3 permanent Sanity points. 

### Additional Rules
Intellectual characters may take a new Archetype Benefit, Resilient. 

* Resilient: If the character reaches 0 Sanity, s/he may immediately roll 1d6; on a 1-2, the character regains 1d3 Sanity points and does not roll on the insanity effects table. 

Feat points may spent to regain SAN:

* Get it together: The character regains 1d3 Sanity points. 

## MASS COMBAT 
(Adapted from [this post](http://privateerpressforums.com/showthread.php?228723-Mass-Combat-in-the-Iron-Kingdoms).) 

Opposing forces are rated (1..4) on each of the following mass combat factors. 

1. Discipline. The score representing the majority of the troops: {0: mob, 1: conscripts, 2: professional, 3: veteran, 4: elite}. 
2. Terrain. Determined by the GM. 
3. Equipment. Plus 1 for each of the following: firearms, magic, warjacks/-beasts, artillery. 
4. Leadership. The Command rating of the highest ranking officer; can be assisted (each successful Command roll at TN=15 gives +1) to a max of 4.
5. Size. The score representing the entire size of the force: {0: squad, 1: platoon, 2: company, 3: battalion, 4: army}. 
6. Intelligence. Determined by the GM. 

Each side then rolls 2d6 and add the sum of the mass combat factors. Highest total wins, with the difference between winner and loser  results interpreted as follows. 

Diff | Effect
-----|-------
1-3 | Light casualties on both sides and the loser is forced to withdraw.
4-6 | Light casualties for the winner, moderate casualties for the loser, and the loser withdraws.
7+  | Light casualties for the winner, heavy casualties for the loser, and the loser routs. Alternatively, the losing side might opt to attempt a retreat prior to battle or else simply surrender if they see this fight coming, as those are really poor odds. 

In the event of a tie, both sides withdraw with minor casualties.

## NON-LETHAL COMBAT
Characters may use Unarmed Combat to inflict non-lethal damage. Non-lethal damage is marked on a character sheet with a single slash. When all of a character’s vitality is marked in this manner s/he falls unconscious. Non-lethal damage marks stack with lethal damage marks; lethal damage marks replace non-lethal damage marks.

## OVERLAND MOVEMENT
Overland by Road, walking, or with a cart.  
8 hours, 16 miles  
16 hours, 32 miles (and a hard day’s walk)  
24 hours, 48 miles (and an extremely fatiguing day)  

Overland by Road, riding or in a coach pulled by a team of horses  
8 hours, 24 miles  
16 hours, 48 miles (and your horse is going to be cranky with you)  
24 hours, 64 miles (buy a new horse, you killed yours. If you're lucky, it's just lame and will need a few weeks to recover)  

Overland without a road, through the wilds, on foot  
8 hours, 6 miles  
16 hours, 10 miles (very fatigued)  
24 hours, 15 miles (near impossible)  

Overland without a road, through the wilds, with a cart (you basically need to make a rough road as you go)  
8 hours, 1 mile (backbreaking labor for a crew of 12/cart)  
16 hours, 2 miles (you'd need a team of 24)  
24 hours, 3 miles (not going to happen in any ordinary circumstance. You'd need a team of 75 maybe.  

Overland by Train (30kph)  
8 hours, 250 miles  
16 hours, 500 miles  
14 hours, 750 miles  

Over sea by boat (7 knots, plus an adjustment for having to tack and not just going in a straight line. Figured @ 80% efficiency.)  
8 hours, 50 miles  
16 hours, 100 miles  
24 hours, 150 miles (unless you sail into an island in the dark, in which case you sink!)  

Over river by steamboat (@ 80% efficiency.)  
8 hours, 25 miles  
16 hours, 50 miles  
24 hours, 75 miles  

## SPONTANEOUS MAGIC
One of the biggest annoyances of the IKRPG is the lack of a proper magic system. Spells were clearly just ported over from the wargame without much thought or effort, causing major discontinuities between the D20 version of the game and the current one, never mind making some spellcaster career useless for anything but combat. Many who came to the game from the P&P RPG, rather than the wargame, find this very unsatisfying.

What’s needed is a supplemental magic system that can complement the current rules without unbalancing the game or causing a dramatic rework of character creation rules. Atlas Games’ [4th ed. Ars Magica](http://www.atlas-games.com/product_tables/AG0204.php) hermetic magic system fits the bill perfectly, with some modifications. 

### System
Spontaneous spells are organized around verb-noun templates (in Latin no less, for flavor). For example, the player wants to turn a Khadoran into a lawn chair. The Technique is Muto (“change”) and the Form is Corpus (“body”). All characters have access to all Techniques, but forms are limited by career, as shown below. 

* Arcanist/Blackclad/Bokor: Animal, Aquam, Auram, Corpus, Herbam, Ignem, Imaginem, Mentem, Terram, Vim
* Advocate of Thamar: Corpus, Ignem, Imaginem, Mentem, Vim
* Sorcerer: Aquam, Auram, Ignem, Terram
* Priest of Morrow: Corpus, Mentem, Vim
* Priest of Menoth: Ignem, Mentem, Vim
* Priest of Dhunia: Animal, Corpus, Herbam
* Priest of the Devourer: Animal, Corpus, Ignem
* Arcane Mechanik: Ignem, Terram
* Warcaster: Ignem, Terram
* Warlock: Animal, Ignem
* Gunmage: Ignem
* Bloodweaver: Corpus

Spontaneous magics should reflect the flavor of a given spellcaster's career choices. Ice Sorcerers, for example, should primarily use forms from the Aquam and Perdo Ignem to emphasize frozen water. Arcane Mechaniks and Warcasters should cast Terram spells impacting mechanika and steamjack components. Gunmages should only use Ignem effects involving force effects. Etc. Also remember that just because a caster can cast a spell of a certain type, doesn't mean s/he should. Some magics (necromancy, mind control, some illusions) are illegal in most of the Iron Kingdoms, and frequent use would quickly bring the attentions of, e.g., the Order of Illumination in Cygnar or the Greylord’s Covenant in Khador.

Spontaneous Casting is subject to two general requirements.

* A character must be a will weaver, focuser, and harnesser to cast a Spontaneous spell. 
* A character must have an appropriate Lore skill in order to cast Spontaneous spells. Lore (Arcane) and Lore (Occult) skills impart knowledge of magical theories and practices necessary to cast spontaneous and ritual spells of different levels of power; they are not required to cast Rote spells, however. Non-Gifted characters can learn these skills to, e.g., identify supernatural phenomena and spells being cast at them, but they can’t power the magical runes that alter reality.

Spontaneous spells take a Full Round Action to cast in combat, or 1 minute outside of combat.

With incorporation of this rule system, spells in IK are of three non-overlapping types. 

* Spontaneous: Free-form spells cast on the fly, according to the Ars Magica Spontaneous Spell rules. 
* Rote: The career-specific spells detailed in the various IK books. Drilled into casters of different traditions, they are fast, powerful, and with few exceptions combat oriented.
* Ritual: Specially designated ritual spells from published IK books.

### Spontaneous Casting Process

1. Determine Technique, Form, and Minimum Lore Skill Level of Effect
The player describes the desired spell Effect, then together with the GM decides on an appropriate Technique, Form, and minimum spell level. The Lore Skill level required for a spell is the Ars Magica spell level divided by 10, rounded up to the nearest integer. Note that this has the (intentional) effect of making certain spell effects impossible for IK characters; no resurrection, teleportation, or spontaneous creation of dragons. The Lore Skill level of “Muto Corpus”, per the guidelines on p.125 of Ars Magica, is 40 ÷ 10 = 4.

    Spells described explicitly in the Ars Magica rules are subject to GM modification.

2. Determine Casting Roll Difficulty
The Casting Difficulty of the spell is determined according to the following equation.

    Casting Difficulty = 10 + Min. Lore Skill Level + Modifiers

    Modifiers include Range, Duration, and Targets. For more details on modifiers, see Ars Magica p.103-105.
        
    Ranges                |  Durations             |  Targets 
    --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------
    +0 Personal           |  +0 Momentary          |  +0 Small 
    +1 Touch/Eye          |  +1 Concentration      |  +1 Individual 
    +2 Reach/Near (4’)    |  +2 Diameter (<1hr.)   |  +2 Group/Room 
    +3 Far (10’)          |  +3 Sun (<24 hrs.)     |  +3 Circle/Structure 
    +4 Sight              |  +4 Moon               |  +4 Boundary 
    +5 Arcane Connection  |  +5 Season             |  +5 Sight
                          |  +6 Year               |
                          |  +7 Perm/Inst          |


    Our “Muto Corpus” has a Difficulty of 22, assuming that the spell targets a single Khadoran within four inches of the caster and remains in effect for 24 hours. At the end of 24 hours, the chair turns back into a very confused Khadoran.

3. Roll for Effect
The player makes a Casting Roll, ARC + Lore Skill + 2d6, to determine whether or not the spell is successfully cast. Spells that target any unwilling characters require an additional ARC + 2d6 Targeting Roll against the DEF rating of the target. These rolls are subject to the following modifiers:
    * Characters that have a crippled Intellect spiral are -2 to both rolls.
    * Spell effects with Requisites (require more than one Technique or Form) impose a -1 Casting Roll penalty for each Requisite.
    * Use of an appropriate focus imparts a +1 bonus to the Casting Roll. An appropriate focus may be career specific (a gunmage uses a rune bullet, a stone sorcerer uses a quantity of earth, etc.) or inspired by the dizzying array of foci on page 87 of Ars Magica. Use of a magical or magickal focus increases the bonus to +2.
    * Up to two assistants may make a Casting Roll at a Difficulty of 15 to provide a +1 bonus to the roll.

4. Incur Fatigue
The Fatigue cost of a Spontaneous spell is equal to the Lore Skill level required to cast it. Additional Fatigue may be incurred for boosting a Targeting or damage roll, as normal.

### Odds and Ends
Conversion of existing Ars Magica spells to IK rules will typically require case by case adjudication from the GM, but the following general guidelines should be helpful.

* Ars Magica doesn't have the special place in its heart for lightning that IK does. To address this, treat the “Ignem” Form as a more general “Energem”, and assume that the Effects of lightning, sonic, and kinetic ('force’) energy spells are mechanically identical to those of fire spells regarding damage amounts, etc.

* For Effects that inflict harm, POW is generally 8 + (damage ÷ 5).

* Magical Healing is subject to the normal Pain of Healing rules. Recovery of a Body Level equates to healing Vitality points equal to the healed character’s stamina.

* Spell descriptions which refer to “demons” affect Undead and Infernals.

### New Abilities
The following abilities are available to any spell casting career.

*Form Mastery*  
The caster gains +2 on Casting Rolls when using a Form or Requisite of a specified type. Ability may be taken multiple times, each with a different Form.

*Adept*  
The caster may reroll a failed Casting Roll. Prerequisite: Lore (Arcane) or Lore (Occult) 3.

*Fast Cast*  
The caster may cast a Spontaneous spell as a quick action.

*Magical Aptitude*  
Casting Rolls are boosted. Casting Rolls are +1d6 if the character is of Veteran or higher level.

### Additional Examples

‘These Are Not the Warjacks You're Looking For’  
Muto Mentem, Lore (Arcane) 1, R: short, D: sun, T: indiv, Diff: 17  
Alter’s the target’s perception of the one item in his immediate memory. Requires a Targeting Roll.
